# BeautyInsights 360

Welcome to the BeautyInsights 360 project! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends for a beauty brand. It leverages Dgraph, a highly scalable and efficient graph database, to handle complex data relationships and provide real-time insights and recommendations.

## Project Overview

BeautyInsights 360 integrates various data sources to analyze customer information, shopping behavior, product reviews, and more. It utilizes advanced analytics and machine learning models to generate personalized product recommendations, optimize inventory, and improve marketing strategies. The project is structured to ensure modularity and ease of use, with clear separation of backend, frontend, and testing components.

## Codebase Structure

### [src/backend folder](src/backend)

**Purpose**: This folder contains the core backend logic of the BeautyInsights 360 project. It includes scripts and modules that handle data analysis, processing, and other backend functionalities. The main script in this folder, `analysis_engine.py`, implements various analysis cases such as customer behavior analysis, product performance evaluation, and sales trend analysis.

### [src/examples folder](src/examples)

**Purpose**: This folder contains example scripts demonstrating how to interact with the Dgraph API using GraphQL. These scripts serve as practical guides for performing common operations such as queries, mutations, and subscriptions. They also include a script for creating mock data in the Dgraph database. The example scripts help users understand how to use the API and integrate it into their own applications.

- `api_query.py`: Example script for GraphQL queries.
- `api_mutation.py`: Example script for GraphQL mutations.
- `api_subscription.py`: Example script for GraphQL subscriptions.
- `create_mock_data.py`: Script for creating mock data in Dgraph.

### [src/tests folder](src/tests)

**Purpose**: This folder contains unit tests for the BeautyInsights 360 project. The tests ensure that the different components of the project are functioning correctly. The main test script, `utest_dgraph_client.py`, includes tests for the `DgraphClient` class, verifying its ability to handle queries, mutations, and subscriptions. Running these tests helps maintain code quality and reliability by catching bugs and issues early in the development process.
